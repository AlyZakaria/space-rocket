# space-rocket
<h2>Game Rules</h2>
<ol>
	<li>In each gameplay, 25 asteroids are generated at random X positions and begin falling towards the space rocket.</li>
	<li>Each asteroid is assigned a random color (red, green, or blue).</li>
	<li>The user should be able to move the space rocket using the mouse without dragging.</li>
	<li>A colored laser beam (red, green, or blue) shoots out the rocket, and the user can change the color of the beam using the "Spacebar".</li>
	<li>The user can destroy asteroids by aligning the laser beam with the asteroid and selecting the same color as the asteroid.</li>
	<li>When an asteroid is successfully destroyed, the score increases by one point.</li>
	<li>There is a time limit of 20 seconds, after which the [Time's Up] screen is displayed with the user's final score.</li>
	<li>The user can press on F1 to restart the game.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that when the user restarts the game, the asteroids' X values are randomly generated once again.</p>
